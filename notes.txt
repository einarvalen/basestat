Weblogic config Cache
=====================
Cache data must contain all data extracted from config.xml
Servername identifies each WebLogic server
PID identifies each instance
Cache key must be an aggregation of servername and PID.
When extracting WebLogic config, consult cache first.
A valid cache entry can be found using it's agregate key - servername and PID
Cache is lazily loaded from persistent store at first use.
At first time usage, the cache will be created empty.
Cache loaded from persistent store may have dirty entries.
A cache-entry is dirty when the server instance is no longer running.
Dirty cache entries must be purged from cache.
Dirty cache is either owing to a server reboot or a server stop.
Reboot can be determined by comparing a running server's PID to what is stored in cache.
A stopped server will no longer have an entry in the process listing - ps
Marking of still valid cache entries can be done when found.
Only when a valid cache entry can NOT be found, the config xml-file will be parsed.
Upon program exit, the cache must be cleaned and saved to persistent storage. 
Cleaning the cache can be acomplished by saving only entries reflecting running servers.
